<h1>History of Furniture</h1>
<p>Furniture is a part of our everyday lives, from sitting in a cafe, using a table, to sleeping in a bed every night. But how did we get to where we are today?
Although there are modern advancements in the furniture we currently use, furniture has been a part of our history for centuries. Aside from the obvious comfort and practicality furniture provides, it has also been a way to reflect social, cultural, and economic developments throughout history.</p>
<p>The first furniture was made in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China. These early civilizations developed the skills and techniques necessary to create basic furniture using materials such as wood, stone, and animal skins.</li>
<li>One thing that has stayed the same throughout furniture’s evolution is the creativity of humans, with societal changes and technical advancements only bringing more light and possibilities to the budding designers of the world. This article will consider furniture’s broad history, exploring the relationship between social, artistic, and cultural factors with historical and contemporary designs.</li>
<li>Prehistoric furniture refers to furniture pieces that date back to the earliest times known to humans. At this stage, furniture wasn’t about the aesthetic value or showing off design skills but for practical uses such as sleeping, storing, and sitting. Materials were incredibly limited at this time, with stone, wood, and animal hides being the primary sources for crafting furniture.</li>
<li>One of the oldest examples of furniture is the Skara Brae settlement, which the Scottish village, Orkney, has preserved.</li>

<p>Skara Brae One of the best preserved Neolithic settlements anywhere in Western Europe</p>
<p>First discovered in 1820, this village dates back to 3100 BC and shows that villagers used stone to make drawers, beds and dressers.</p>
<li>Furniture was also an integral part of both Ancient Egyptian and Greek culture, in which wood was the primary material used, with stone lent to more dramatic furniture, such as thrones and ceremonial pieces.
While prehistoric furniture lacked the style and intricateness of modern-day furniture, these early designs are the reason that we have practical furniture today and were pivotal in the evolution of design and production.</li>
